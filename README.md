# STAT GR5398 – MA Mentored Research (Spring 2026)  
## AI4Finance Open-Source Research Track

This repository hosts the official project hub for **[STAT GR5398](https://ma.stat.columbia.edu/stat-gr5398-ma-mentored-research/) – MA Mentored Research (Spring 2026)** at Columbia University, led by **Bruce Yang**, Founder & President of the **AI4Finance Foundation**.

This course is designed as a **research-driven, open-source, and production-oriented** mentored research experience. Students will work on **real-world systems** that are already used by researchers, practitioners, and industry teams in quantitative finance and AI.

All projects are based on **large-scale open-source frameworks** maintained by the AI4Finance Foundation and emphasize:

- Research depth  
- Engineering rigor  
- Real-world validation  
- Open-source contribution  

---

## Course Structure

Students choose **one of three research directions**.  
Each direction provides **three project options**, allowing flexibility while maintaining a unified research theme.

> **Important**  
> This is **not a tutorial-style course**. Each direction requires sustained commitment (approximately **30 hours per week**) and is suitable for students aiming for:
> - Research publications  
> - PhD preparation  
> - Advanced industry roles in AI / quantitative finance

## Direction 1: FinRL-Trading — Quantitative Trading Systems  
**Difficulty: High (Engineering-Intensive)**

**FinRL-Trading** is a modern, modular quantitative trading platform built with Python, featuring machine learning and reinforcement learning strategies, professional backtesting, and live trading capabilities.

**Open-Source Framework**  
https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Trading

### What You Will Do
- Design and implement **end-to-end quantitative trading strategies**
- Integrate ML / RL signals into the FinRL-Trading framework
- Run **realistic paper trading (fake money)** against live market data
- Evaluate performance, risk, and robustness under real market conditions

### Expectations
- Strong Python engineering ability
- Solid understanding of financial markets
- Comfort working with complex, modular, production-level systems

### Outcomes & Opportunities
- Outstanding contributors may receive:
  - **Unpaid internship offers** from AI4Finance-affiliated projects
  - **Scholarship support** for strategies demonstrating strong empirical performance
- Strong projects may evolve into **open-source benchmarks or research papers**

## Direction 2: FinRobot — AI-Driven Equity Research  
**Difficulty: Medium**

**FinRobot** is an open-source AI Agent platform for **automated equity research and financial analysis using large language models (LLMs)**.

**Framework**  
https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot  

**Live Demo**  
https://finrobot.ai

### What You Will Do
- Build AI agents that generate **professional-grade equity research reports**
- Apply LLMs to:
  - Financial statement analysis  
  - Business and industry modeling  
  - Investment thesis generation  
- Extend or customize the FinRobot agent architecture

### Open-Source Commitment
- The **entire FinRobot codebase will be fully open-sourced during the semester**
- Students will build directly on **production-level systems**, not toy examples

### Expected Output
- A complete, reproducible **Equity Research Report**
- Clear methodology, prompt design, and evaluation logic
- Optional research-style write-up suitable for publication

## Direction 3: FinGPT — Financial Sentiment Analysis with LLMs  
**Difficulty: Medium (Data + Modeling Focus)**

**FinGPT** is an open-source financial large language model project focused on real-world financial NLP tasks.

**Framework**  
https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT

### This Semester’s Focus
We will build a **financial data platform** that integrates:
- News  
- Social media  
- Buy-side / institutional opinions  

Using this data, students will:
- Design data pipelines and labeling strategies
- Fine-tune FinGPT models for financial sentiment analysis
- Validate model performance in **real or near-real market settings**

### Skills Emphasized
- Data engineering and curation
- LLM fine-tuning and evaluation
- Financial NLP and sentiment modeling

### Expected Output
- A cleaned and well-documented dataset (or subset)
- A fine-tuned FinGPT model
- Empirical evaluation linked to real market signals

## Open-Source & Research Philosophy

All projects:
- Are **open-source by default**
- Follow **research-grade standards** (reproducibility, documentation, evaluation)
- Encourage **upstream contributions** to AI4Finance repositories

Students are expected to think and operate as:
- Researchers  
- Engineers  
- System builders  

---

## Evaluation & Mentorship

Evaluation is based on:
- Technical depth
- Research rigor
- Code quality
- Original contribution

Top-performing students may:
- Be invited to **co-author research papers**
- Receive long-term research mentorship
- Continue with AI4Finance projects beyond the semester

---

## Who Should Take This Course

This course is ideal for students who:
- Seek **real research experience**, not simulated coursework
- Are comfortable working with **large, evolving codebases**
- Aim for **PhD programs, research labs, or advanced industry roles**
- Are willing to commit significant time and effort
